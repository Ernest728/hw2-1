# hw2-1
 (1) how to setup and run your program

I made a period of 50ms for PWM, with 20 samples in Ramp function R(), so the period of the ramp function is 1 sec. I use four for loop to generate Ramp function for my needs. Then in the while loop, I use a for loop to change pulsewidth in a period of 5ms.

 (2) what are the results

A breathing LED controlled by Ramp pulse.
